## reactive-planning
A small Meteor & React app to help build plannings

**If you are interested by this project please file an issue to let me know
and I'll make the necessary work to remove any client-specific code so we
can work together.**

### Installation

Just run `meteor`

### TODO

* Add cell filling by clicking them then clicking a user in the people list
  * When clicking a cell, display on the right only the people available
* Add proper restrictions for non-admin users
